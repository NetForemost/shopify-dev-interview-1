## Notes
- * Use the files on this repository, to complete the tasks.
- * Imagine that you are going to build a store that sells coffee.

## Task 1
Please set up a development store by creating a Shopify account or using an existing one. Once your store is set up, import the product_template.csv, you will find this file on the assets. Also, create at least one collection and assign some of the created products. This will help organize your products within the store.

## Task 2
Build a basic featured image section using the file called featured-image.liquid on the sections folder.
Please take into account the following items:
1. Try to follow this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/b2oGIEYWNld78JaMSVpgLI/Shopify-Dev-Technical-Test?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=ZSbknG6dI9b596C3-1).
1. A button is missing in the section, you should implement a basic JSON schema in order to display a button.
2. You should create the html and styles for this new section.

## Task 3
Update the content of a existing popup that appears when the "Checkout" button is clicked on the cart page. The popup is already functional, and its content is identified by the "modal-content" ID. The goal is to use the "/cart.json" endpoint to fetch the latest cart information and update the content dynamically within the popup.

# Extra Task (Only if there is still time left)
Add the featured collection section and make it similar to the design on this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/b2oGIEYWNld78JaMSVpgLI/Shopify-Dev-Technical-Test?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=ZSbknG6dI9b596C3-1).

Please carefully read all the instructions and requirements before starting the test.

Good luck with the test!
